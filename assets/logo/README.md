# Logo Instructions

To add your NeerGauge logo:

1. Save your logo image as `neergauge.png` in this directory (`assets/logo/`)
2. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels (PNG format with transparent background)
3. The logo should be the water droplet with gauge design as shown in your reference

The app will automatically use this logo for:
- Splash screen on app startup
- Top bar in the home screen
- App icon (if configured)

If the logo file is missing, the app will fall back to a vector-drawn version.
